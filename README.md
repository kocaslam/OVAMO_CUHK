# OVAMO_CUHK
Software development for the OVAMO system for anaerobic microbial culture using 96 well plate:
an online tutorial with raw data, examples and codes.

As for query and bug report, please contact:
cufns_kocas@link.cuhk.edu.hk

Codes used for the explortive analysis of fermentation,
such as probiotics prebotics fermetnation to investigation
new prebiotics and engineer new probiotics strains.

There are a total of four parts:
  1) Part 0 - Wet lab of microbial growth; 
  2) Part I - Growth characteristics; 
  3) Part II - Explorative analysis;
  4) Part III - Prebiotic structure integration (optional).
  
Users are guided from the very begnning in obtaining the OD readout from microplat readers
to the final output of explorative analysis output to gain biological insights.
Softwares installation, data arrangement, parameters suggestion, and raw data files,
were provided to make the online tuturial more users-friednly.

Part III - Prebiotic structure integration might optional if users lack prebioitc structural data.
