# OVAMO_CUHK
Online tutorial for microbial growth parameters (lag, maximum growth rate and maximum population increase) determination
and structure-property relationship investigation using random forest analysis.

The tutorial adopted the OVAMO system for anaerobic microbial culture using 96 well plate,
with raw data, examples and codes provided.

As for queries and bug report, please contact:

The online tutorial also involved other open-source softwares.
Please respect copy-right and cite the sources of softwares and codes used appropriately.

Codes used for the exploratory analysis of fermentation,
such as probiotics prebiotics fermentation to investigate
new prebiotics and engineer new probiotics strains.

There are a total of four parts:
  1) Part 0 - Wet lab of microbial growth kinetic pattern; 
  2) Part I - Growth parameters determination; 
  3) Part II - Exploratory analysis;
  4) Part III - Structure integration (optional).
  
Users are guided from the very beginning in obtaining the OD readout from microplate readers
to the final output of exploratory analysis output to gain biological insights.
Softwares installation, data arrangement, parameters suggestion, and
some raw data files, were provided to make the online tutorial more user-friendly.

This online tutorial only served as a starting point for user to get accquanted to
the integration of exploratory and random forest analysis (machine learning) in polymer research.

We adopted an example of carbohydrate polymer and probiotic in vitro fermentation study.
Users could check on their biological question to see how should similar approach be applied to their investigation.
