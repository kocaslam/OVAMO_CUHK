# OVAMO_CUHK
Software development for the OVAMO system for anaerobic microbial culture using 96 well plate

Codes used for the explortive analysis of fermentation,
such as probiotics prebotics fermetnation to investigation
new prebiotics and engineer new probiotics strains.

There are a total of four parts:
  1) Part 0 - Wet lab of microbial growth; 
  2) Part I - Growth characteristics; 
  3) Part II - Explorative analysis; 
  4) Part III - Genomics integration (optional);
  5) Part IV - Structure integration (optional);
  6) Part extra - CAZyme annotation.
  
Users are guided from the very begnning in obtaining the OD readout from microplat readers
to the final output of explorative analysis output to gain biological insights.

Part III - Genomics integration (optional) is optional as it requred the input of genome
to predict the CAZymes profile for integration analysis.
