# OVAMO_CUHK
Online tutorial for structure-property relationship investigation using random forest analysis.

The tutorial adopted the OVAMO system for anaerobic microbial culture using 96 well plate,
with raw data, examples and codes provided.

As for query and bug report, please contact:
cufns_kocas@link.cuhk.edu.hk or kocaslam@gmail.com

The online tutorial also involved other open-source softwares.
Please respect copy-right and cite the sources of softwares and codes used appropriately.

  Ka-Lung LAM. 2019. Software development for the OVAMO system for anaerobic microbial culture using 96 well plate. https://github.com/kocaslam/OVAMO_CUHK/.

Codes used for the exploratory analysis of fermentation,
such as probiotics prebotics fermetnation to investigation
new prebiotics and engineer new probiotics strains.

There are a total of four parts:
  1) Part 0 - Wet lab of microbial growth; 
  2) Part I - Growth parameters determination; 
  3) Part II - Explorative analysis;
  4) Part III - Structure integration (optional).
  
Users are guided from the very begnning in obtaining the OD readout from microplat readers
to the final output of explorative analysis output to gain biological insights.
Softwares installation, data arrangement, parameters suggestion, and
some raw data files, were provided to make the online tuturial more users-friednly.

Part III - Prebiotic structure integration might optional if users lack prebioitc structural data.
