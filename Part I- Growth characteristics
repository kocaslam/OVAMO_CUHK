Part I: Growth characteristics detrmination.

Growth charactersiitc: 
  1) Maximum growth rate;
  2) Maximum popuatiob increasee:
  3) Lag ohase.

The foloowing use the software GrowthRate to determinate the growth characteristics.
It is a non-parametric method, i.e., not based on growth model.
It provides better curve fitting behaviour.

Please cite the following for using the GrowthRate software:
Hall BG, Acar H, Nandipati A, Barlow M. 2014. Growth rates made easy. Mol Biol Evol. 311: 232â€“238.

GrowtRate was available for different pflatform:
Linux: https://sourceforge.net/projects/growthrates/files/GrowthRates%203.0%20Linux.zip/download
macOS: https://sourceforge.net/projects/growthrates/files/GrowthRates%203.0%20Mac.zip/download
Windows: https://sourceforge.net/projects/growthrates/files/GrowthRates%203.0%20Windows.zip/download

Here, we demostrated the use in macOS platform.
For other platform, please refer to the manual provided.
