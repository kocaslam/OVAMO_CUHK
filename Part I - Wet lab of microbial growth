Part I - Wet lab of microbial growth

The OVAMO system was adapted.

Sterile 96 well plates are needed.

Fermentation mixture include:
1) 100 µL of modified Medium for Colonic Bacteria, mMCB
2) Individual carbohydrates (a total of 11 carbohydrates) at a final concentration of 1% (w/v)
3) 2% individual bacterial inoculum
4) 2% OxyraseR was added to each well

96 well plate + fermentation mixture
-> vacuum (70 cmHg) to de-gas for 5 minutes to remove any bubbles formed and dissolved gas;
-> 100 µL of sterilized mineral oil was carefully overlaid in each well.

Blank control wells without bacteria and carbohydrate sources were also included to check for the sterility of the medium.
Negative control wells were also included.

We recommended a biological triplicate with each replicate one plate,
i.e., if we have 6 x 11 and blank and control wells,
we put them in one plate
and prepare a total of three plates.
Therefore, each plate normalized to the same blank well.

OD600 was then recorded using different micro-plate reader with kinetic mode,
e.g.: TECAN Infinite M200 Microplate Reader (TECAN Group Ltd., Switzerland)

After the completion of the measurement, raw data were exported in Excel format for further analysis.
