Low-Cost Method Generating In Situ Anaerobic Conditions on a 96-Well Plate for Microbial Fermentation in Food Research

Abstract:
Commercial tools and instruments have been developed for a screening study of microbial fermentation,
but they are expensive and mostly confined to aerobic fermentation only.
There is little development on the generation of anaerobic conditions directly on a 96-well plate.
This report proposed a simple and versatile microbial fermentation system known as OVAMO
that makes use of Oxyrase, vacuum, and mineral oil to
generate an in situ anaerobic environment on a 96-well plate for at least 48 h.
The practicality of OVAMO in anaerobic fermentation experiments used for functional food research
was validated by a prebiotic screening study of different carbohydrates by Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis.
The OVAMO system provides a less expensive but effective way to conduct a microbial fermentation screening study
that requires anaerobic conditions without the need for atmospheric control by external devices.
