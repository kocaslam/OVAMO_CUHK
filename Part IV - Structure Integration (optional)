Part IV - Structure Integration (optional)

This part is meant for the integration analysi with structure data available.

Structure data can be from different chemical/instrumental analysis, for example:
  1) total carbohydrate;
  2) total protein;
  3) molecular weight from HPLC;
  4) mono-saccharide composition;
  5) linkage of polymer chain;
  6) special function groups
  7) solubility
  ...

these data can also be integrated into the analysis with growth characteristics. including:
  1) lag phase;
  2) maximum growth rate;
  3) maximum population increase.

Integration analysis could be done in different ways.
Mainly, a machine learning approach is taken.
As new algorithm is being pushed out and old algorithm is being updated,
users could choose their suitable analysis method.

Here, we demostrtaed how it is done using the decision tree approach.
